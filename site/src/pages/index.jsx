            Location information drives much of the context for the applications we use on our mobile devices. However, for the features of these apps to work we have to provide our GPS location. When we share this information we are trading our privacy for convenience. This trade-off is not always equitable or worth the cost. Sometimes we have to provide full GPS tracking for applications to function at all, in this case the information about our daily life is revealed in full detail.

          <p>
            We believe there is an opportunity to create a general purpose open source library to allow individuals to prove their presence at a location. It will use Zero Knowledge techniques to protect the actual location. And it will use a combination of collaborative algorithms run on/by several parties to prove you were in a particular area without sharing your exact coordinates in your location history.

           This project is open source software library and tool kit that can be used by application developers and others. It will support the creation of GPS based proof-of-presence techniques that preserve the privacy of the individual. There will be corresponding ZK circuits and validator code examples. It will also be packaged with appropriate documentation. Please help us on this quest and consider joining the project and community!

            The plan for this ZK Locale library project isâ€¦
          </p>
          <p>
            1) Research proof methods for location and time based activities that provide a comfortable level of privacy preservation.
          </p>
          <p>
            2) Build a verification framework for validating proofs accuracy, security, and privacy
          </p><p>
            3) Develop proofs in at least two ZK frameworks to compare with verification framework
          </p><p>
            4) Choose winning proof technique based on validation framework
          </p><p>
            5) Develop initial library and demo application
          </p><p>
            6) Work with community to further develop, improve, validate the library
          </p><p>
            7) Provide several working examples of how to use the ZK locale library in modern software apps (mobile, cloud, web3). 
          </p><p>
            8) Support on-going community growth and open source development efforts
          </p>
          <p>
           The plan is subject to change as we develop a more detailed understand of the problem space and what development options are available at this time. Please check back often or consider joining the community to stay up-to-date.
